C# OOP calculator

Hello, 

This is my attempt at a OOP calculator just as a proof of concept.

There are two object classes NumberStock and OperationStock. They are just getter and setter classes.

Also there is a basic calc class used to cover the basic +,-,*,/ as of this moment.

There is a draw.io map to show the data flow of this method and hopefully, some extentions can be added as i go along.
